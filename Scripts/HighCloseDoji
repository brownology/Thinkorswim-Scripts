#High Close Doji (HCD) and Low Close Doji (LCD) with average true Range Stop\
#Below is a set of scripts that incorporates a STOP using average true range 
#once a High Close Doji (HCD) and Low Close Doji (LCD) has been identified.

#HCD and LCD are used by John Person and it can be useful for identifying a high probability success trade. 
#By incorporating a stop (e.g., Risk Management) using the average true range one can objectively identify 
#a stop by incorporating some elements of dynamics (e.g. volatility).
